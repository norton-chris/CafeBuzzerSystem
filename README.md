# CafeBuzzerSystem
This is the repository for the Cafe Notification System for Michigan Tech.

The program takes a order number and a point of contact which is either a phone number or email.
When the user enters this information it saves in the system and waits for the Cafe cooks to enter in their order number. When they enter the order number the customer will get a notification that their order is ready to be picked up.

The notification system is a cost effective method to replace the previous buzzers that were implemented in the Cafe a few year prior to this, and this also saves the Cafe cooks voice because they won't have to yell out the numbers everytime an order is ready.

We hope to have this system in Cafe by mid December 2019.
